# Story behind Morse Code

In 1825, Samuel Morse was working in Washington DC when he received a letter that read, "Your dear wife is convalescent."  The next day, while packing, he received another letter... his wife Susan had already died.

He rushed home to New Haven to attend the funeral and arrived to find his wife had already been buried. Heartbroken that he had missed–well, everything–Samuel vowed to find a way to deliver messages instantly, so no one would feel the pain of being separated from loved ones in their most important moments.

Eight years later, he met Charles Thomas Jackson, and they both shared an interest in transmitting information quickly over long distances through electronic impulses. Samuel envisioned a mechanical device called the telegraph, which could send impulses over any distance, and he developed a system of dots and dashes to transmit messages through electrical impulses over wires. After more than a decade of work, Morse successfully demonstrated his telegraph on January 11, 1838, changing the way the world communicated and connecting people during important moments.

# What is Morese Code?

The term Morse Code refers to either of two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes, and spaces. The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights. The two systems are the original “American” Morse Code and the later International Morse Code, which became the global standard.

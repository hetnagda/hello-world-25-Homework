This game was developed as an assignment given to us by our professors. They challenged us to create an engaging game using only __a single button__. Embracing this constraint led to the creation of "Twirl Trouble."

## Welcome to Twirl Trouble

üå™Ô∏è Welcome to the world of "Twirl Trouble," where you help the crazy circle dodge those pesky rectangles while racking up points!

## How to Play

1. üîÑ Control the circle's direction with the SPACE bar.
2. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Score 1 point for every clockwise rotation you complete.
3. üöß Beware of the rectangles! Collide, and it's game over!

Get ready to spin, dodge, and laugh your way to the top of the leaderboard. Are you up for the challenge?
